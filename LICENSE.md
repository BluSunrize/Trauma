Blu's License of Common Sense
====================================

Here's how it goes: I like making my code visible so that others may learn from it. Reason for that is because I myself learned a lot that way.
What I don't like is anyone's creative property being stolen, used without credit or commercialized without permission.

As such, this is my custom license which should hopefully cover all that:

#### What you *can* do:
- Look at the code, draw inspiration, copy bits of it to use in your own projects
- Fork this repository and modify its code
- Submit Pull Requests to this repository
- Write other projects that baes on this project and its API (if present) (This means Addons are totally cool)

#### What you *can not* do:
- Claim any of this code to be your property
- Redistribute this project (source or compiled) without explicit permission of the license holder, BluSunrize
- Copy large sections of this code (classes, complex methods) without giving credit
- Monetize any of this project. This means selling the code, compiled projects and also forbids the use of paywalls or "donations" to restrict access to any part of the project's content. I specifically exempt CurseForge's "Points"-system from this statement.

#### What you *have to* abide by:
- Have any projects based on this be visible source. It helps others learn just as this helped you.
- Give proper credit where it's due when copying copy (see above)

#### On the topic of *resources*:
- Always give credit to original artists
- Always ask for permission before copying assets
- Addons mods are allowed to use and remix art assets for the sole purpose of being addons. When in doubt, better ask.

#### Contributing to this repository:
- The original author keeps copyright of their contibuted code and resources
- The owner of this repository is given rights to usage and modification of the contributed code or resource. This may not be withdrawn
- Any code or resource submitted must be licensed to this project with this license

#### In summary:
Please, look at the code and learn from it (where possible). Draw inspiration, be creative, enjoy yourself. Should you find issues, point them out. Have an idea how to fix it? Submit a PR.
Stealing code or assets isn't cool though. Don't do that.

Lastly, I hereby reserve the right to revoke this license's permissions from people who violate [Wheaton's Law](http://www.wheatonslaw.com).
